# C-Programs
This repository contains some of the C++ projects which I have done in my university.
C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language
In naturally written C++ code, changing the private members of a class requires recompilation of the code using the class. When the class is used to instantiate member objects of other classes, the rule is of course applied recursively. This makes C++ interfaces very unstable - a change invisible at the interface level still requires to rebuild the calling code, which can be very problematic when that code is not controlled by whoever makes the change. So shipping C++ interfaces to customers can be a bad idea. Well, at least when all relevant code is controlled by the same team of people, the only problem is the frequent rebuilds of large parts of it. This wouldn't be too bad by itself with almost any language, but C++ has...
